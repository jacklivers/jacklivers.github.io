      <description>March Madness has come and gone, Jesus “is risen”, and fans are back in MLB stadiums. As much as I’d like to talk about baseball, I have to talk about my March Madness machine learning bracket (from the Ides of Machine Learning blog post) did.
If you couldn’t tell from the title, I finished dead last out of the entire group that took part in this, that’s 17th place.</description>

      <description>Every year come March the nation comes together for one reason, basketball. Since last year’s Madness was canceled it made the anticipation for this year that much greater. Many people fill out brackets, from sports nuts to Karen in the office who makes picks based on uniform color, mascots, anything not basketball related.
I haven’t filled out a bracket in many years because I haven’t seen the point, but this year I used machine learning to make my March Madness picks.</description>
