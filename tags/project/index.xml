      <description>Every year come March the nation comes together for one reason, basketball. Since last year’s Madness was canceled it made the anticipation for this year that much greater. Many people fill out brackets, from sports nuts to Karen in the office who makes picks based on uniform color, mascots, anything not basketball related.
I haven’t filled out a bracket in many years because I haven’t seen the point, but this year I used machine learning to make my March Madness picks.</description>
