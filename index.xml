      <description>Every year come March the nation comes together for one reason, basketball. Since last year’s Madness was canceled it made the anticipation for this year that much greater. Many people fill out brackets, from sports nuts to Karen in the office who makes picks based on uniform color, mascots, anything not basketball related.
I haven’t filled out a bracket in many years because I haven’t seen the point, but this year I used machine learning to make my March Madness picks.</description>

      <description>Folks (man pinches front brim of hat downward making salutations), this is my first post on the blog. While I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what will all go up on this blog, the main purpose is to showcase what I&amp;rsquo;ve done in RStudio. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll stop binge watching SVU in my spare time and start playing with numbers and such in RStudio, but one step at a time. All the big projects I&amp;rsquo;ve done in RStudio deal with baseball data, but in the near term I&amp;rsquo;ll be dealing with some basketball data.</description>
